Descending-
Number of Intructions-23
Current time-1385


Prime
Number of Instructions - 16
Current time-145


Fibonacci-
Number of Instructions-20
Current Time-390

EVENodd
Number of Instructions-9
Current Time - 30

Palindrome-
Number of Instructions-16
Current Time-245

Observation:
We can observe that as the number of instructions are increasing the time taken for the instructions to be executed also simultaneously. 
In some cases even if the instruction count is the same the complexity of the instruction execution determines the time taken for execution.
